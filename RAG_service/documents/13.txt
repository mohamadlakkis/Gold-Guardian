Bitcoin, Gold Analysis: Ceasefire, Holidays, and US Data
Bitcoin, Gold Analysis: Ceasefire agreements are transitioning from speculation to reality ahead of the holiday season and Trump’s upcoming term. Gold’s rally has stalled below the $2,700 mark as haven demand wanes, while Bitcoin has retreated slightly below the psychological $100,000 level.

Key Events:

    Israel-Lebanon Ceasefire Agreement 
    US Data Release (Today): GDP, unemployment claims, durable goods orders, and Core PCE

Upcoming US data releases today may introduce volatility to the US Dollar, gold, and Bitcoin. With preliminary GDP results, durable goods orders, and Core PCE on the table, market movements could accelerate. However, the "Trump effect" is beginning to overshadow Fed policy, shifting the market focus to potential 2025 Trump-driven initiatives.

On the global front, German and Eurozone inflation data due Thursday and Friday could trigger volatility in euro pairs, which would inversely affect the dollar. 

Ceasefire Hopes and Market Sentiment

The finalized ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon has raised optimism for similar resolutions in the Israel-Gaza conflict and the Russia-Ukraine war. The holiday season adds a layer of emotional relief, but questions linger over the potential for a "Santa Claus rally" in gold and Bitcoin, as geopolitical and economic factors remain highly influential.

Title of Graph: Bitcoin / USD Weekly Chart with Elliott Wave Analysis and RSI Divergence

Trend Analysis:

    Wave Formation: The chart is structured around Elliott Wave principles, suggesting:
        A completed impulsive wave (Wave V) reaching a high near $98,966.
        A corrective phase appears imminent, given the possible exhaustion of Wave V.
    Price Movement:
        The price has risen from ~$15,500 (2022 low) to a peak near $98,966 in 2024.
        A sharp decline in the latest candle indicates potential profit-taking or bearish sentiment at the current level.

Key Metrics:

    All-Time High (ATH): ~$98,966.
    Current Price: ~$93,237, reflecting a pullback.
    Key Support Levels:
        $78,000 (first corrective target if Wave V ends).
        $66,000 (next support zone in a deeper correction).
    Resistance Levels:
        $98,000 - $100,000 (psychological resistance).

Moving Averages:

    Moving averages are not explicitly shown, but the overall trend suggests the price is trading well above long-term averages, indicating bullish momentum.

Historical Comparisons:

    2020-2021 Rally: The current rally resembles the previous bull run, with a parabolic rise followed by a corrective phase.
    2022-2023 Bear Market: The recovery aligns with the historical trend of strong rebounds following deep corrections.

Market Indicators:

    RSI Divergence:
        The RSI shows bearish divergence as the price makes new highs, but RSI fails to confirm, indicating weakening bullish momentum.
        RSI is currently at 66.26, suggesting overbought conditions easing.
    Elliott Wave Completion:
        The fifth wave of the impulsive structure appears complete, pointing toward a corrective ABC pattern or consolidation phase.

Future Projections:

    Bullish Case:
        A breakout above $98,000 could push the price toward $120,000, aligning with the upper boundary of the channel.
    Bearish Case:
        A break below $90,000 may trigger a correction to $78,000, followed by $66,000 in a deeper retracement scenario.
    Neutral Case:
        Consolidation between $90,000 and $98,000 is likely if the bullish trend pauses for reaccumulation.

Investor Decision Support:

    Opportunities:
        Monitor for a breakout above $98,000 to capture bullish momentum.
        Consider partial profit-taking near current highs, given overbought conditions and Elliott Wave completion.
    Warnings:
        Be cautious of a deeper correction to $78,000 or $66,000 if bearish divergence on RSI intensifies.
        Avoid entering long positions near ATH without confirmation of sustained breakout.

Bitcoin’s recent pullback near the $100,000 level, as highlighted in the previous analysis 'Is Bitcoin's Rally Losing Steam?' reflects heavy selling pressure at this psychological milestone. The festive season may slow momentum temporarily, with a potential recharge for the rally in January 2025. Key Levels:

Bullish Scenario: A firm close above $100,000 could fuel the next leg of the rally, targeting $113,000, $120,000, and eventually $145,000

Bearish Scenario: Initial support lies between $79,000 and $77,000. A deeper pullback could target key supports at $67,000 (mid-channel), $57,000, and $47,000 (bottom channel boundary).

    Bearish Case:
        Failure to hold $2,500 support could lead to a drop toward $2,280, the next key support level.

Investor Decision Support:

        Enter long positions on a confirmed breakout above $2,700 for higher targets within the channel.
        Consider adding positions near $2,500 support if bullish momentum resumes.
    Warnings:
        Monitor for bearish RSI divergence; it indicates weakening bullish strength.
        Avoid long positions if $2,500 support breaks, as this could trigger a deeper corrective phase.

Gold continues to respect its long-term uptrend channel, established since the 2023 lows. The recent pullback was partly driven by optimism around the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire, which eased haven demand. However, the possibility of a Santa Claus rally could rekindle bullish momentum. Key Levels:

Bullish Scenario: A firm close back inside the channel and above $2,760 could push gold towards $2,890 and $3,050

Bearish Scenario: Short-term supports at $2,600 and $2,580 remain critical. A break below these levels could trigger a retracement to $2,530, $2,480, or even $2,300 in extreme cases.
