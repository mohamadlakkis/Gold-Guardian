Bullish bets on the yen continue to gain traction: COT report 
We may have seen an important swing low on the yen looking at the change of speculative market positioning. And that could see a much deeper pullback on USD/JPY.
Market positioning from the COT report – Tuesday, 26 November 2024:

    Large speculators decreased their net-short exposure to JPY futures for the first week in eight, by 18k contracts (15.9k longs were added, -3.1k shorts were closed)
    They increased long exposure to EUR/USD futures by 17.6% (29,422 contracts) and reduced shorts by -3.6% (-5.7k contracts)
    Net-short exposure to CHF futures rose to a 17-week high among large speculators
    While large speculators pushed net-long exposure to AUD/USD futures to a near 7-year high, asset managers increased their net-short exposure by 5.9k contracts
    Large speculators were their most bearish on NZD futures in 12 months heading into the RBNZ meeting, with a net-short exposure of -18.5k contracts
    Net-short exposure against CAD futures decreased for the first week in seven, although by a mere –434 contracts
    Short exposure to WTI crude oil futures declined by -7.8% (-1.7k contracts)
    They also reduced short exposure to gold by -6% (-4.8k contracts) and silver futures by -7.9% (-1.7k contracts)

3. Moving Averages

    Moving averages are not directly depicted in the chart but could be inferred from open interest trends in key asset classes like gold and equities.

4. Historical Comparisons

    The positive sentiment in gold and silver aligns with recent trends during times of economic uncertainty or inflationary pressure.
    The net short positions in currencies like JPY and CHF are consistent with prior bearish sentiment as these currencies weaken against the USD.
    The equities market (S&P 500, Nasdaq) shows a continuation of speculative bullishness, consistent with prior recovery trends.

5. Market Indicators

    Gold and Silver: Act as safe-haven assets, attracting strong speculative interest during inflationary periods or geopolitical tensions.
    Bonds: Bearish sentiment in the bond market reflects expectations of rising interest rates or reduced bond demand.
    VIX: Neutral to bearish sentiment indicates low expectations for significant market volatility.
    WTI Crude Oil: Positive speculative sentiment reflects strong demand or expectations for supply constraints.

6. Future Projections

    Gold and Silver: Likely to maintain bullish momentum, particularly if inflation persists or economic uncertainty increases.
    Currencies: Bearish trends in currencies like JPY and CAD may continue unless there are significant policy or market shifts.
    Equities: Positive speculative sentiment suggests further upside potential in the stock market, particularly in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.
    Bonds: Bearish sentiment may persist, especially if interest rate hikes are anticipated.
    WTI Crude Oil: Continued bullish positioning indicates expectations for sustained demand or reduced supply.

7. Investor Decision Support

    Opportunities:
        Favorable conditions for long positions in gold and silver due to strong speculative sentiment.
        Consider equities like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq for bullish trades, leveraging positive speculative sentiment.
        Crude oil (WTI) offers potential upside for traders seeking to benefit from strong demand trends.
    Warnings:
        Avoid bearish currencies (e.g., JPY, CAD) unless there is a reversal in speculative sentiment.
        Monitor bond market developments, as bearish positioning indicates potential headwinds.
        Be cautious in overextending long positions in VIX, given its neutral to bearish speculative outlook.
    Strategic Insight:
        Diversify exposure across positively positioned asset classes like gold, silver, and equities while hedging risks in underperforming sectors like bonds and certain currencies.

Metals (gold, silver, copper) futures - COT report:

Net-long exposure to metals remains within a ‘cooling off’ period after being aggressively bullish earlier this year. While gold prices have tried to recover, large speculators and asset managers remain hesitant to chase the move higher. For this reason, I continue to suspect that the current recovery will fail to simply reach a fresh record high, and instead print a new cycle low as part of a deeper retracement. And if gold continues to falter, to too will silver.

Copper prices have also failed to regain bullish traction despite stimulus from Beijing. And that is also being reflected in a lacklustre level of net-long exposure to the metal.
