Graph analyis of gold price trends from December 2023 to December 2024
1. Trend Analysis

    The chart depicts the spot gold price in USD per ounce from December 2023 to December 2024.
    Starting at approximately $2,000 per ounce in December 2023, the price exhibits an upward trend overall, with fluctuations along the way.
    A significant price surge occurs between March and April 2024, where gold rises sharply from $2,100 to around $2,400 per ounce.
    Between July and October 2024, there is another notable increase, with the price climbing from $2,400 to a peak of around $2,700 per ounce in November.
    A small correction is observed in late November and early December 2024, where prices slightly decline but stabilize above $2,600 per ounce.

2. Key Metrics

    Highest price: Approximately $2,700 per ounce in November 2024.
    Lowest price: Close to $2,000 per ounce in December 2023.
    Volatility: High, with sharp price increases in March-April and July-November, followed by a small dip in November-December.

3. Moving Averages

    The chart does not display explicit moving averages, but a long-term upward trend suggests the moving averages (e.g., 50-day, 200-day) would reflect a bullish alignment.
    If calculated, the moving averages would likely show support levels near $2,400-$2,500 per ounce, aligning with the consolidation periods seen in the mid-year.

4. Historical Comparisons

    Compared to past trends (not explicitly shown here), the rise from $2,000 to $2,700 per ounce indicates a strong bullish trend, possibly driven by macroeconomic factors like inflation, geopolitical instability, or increased demand for safe-haven assets.

5. Market Indicators

    Support levels: Around $2,400 per ounce (mid-year consolidation zone) and $2,600 per ounce (current stabilization after correction).
    Resistance levels: Near $2,700 per ounce, which marked the recent peak in November 2024.
    The sharp rise in prices during March-April and July-November suggests breakouts triggered by strong buying momentum or external market factors.

6. Future Projections

    The upward trend suggests that gold may continue to serve as a preferred safe-haven asset, potentially targeting new highs above $2,700 per ounce if the bullish momentum persists.
    However, the recent correction indicates possible consolidation near $2,600 per ounce, with risks of further declines if market conditions stabilize or improve.
    Investors should monitor key economic indicators (e.g., inflation rates, central bank policies) and geopolitical developments for potential market shifts.

7. Investor Decision Support

    Opportunities: Consider buying on dips near $2,600 per ounce if the upward trend remains intact, targeting resistance at $2,700 per ounce and beyond.
    Warnings: Be cautious of further corrections if prices break below $2,600 per ounce, which could signal a reversal or prolonged consolidation.
    Strategic Insight: Diversify gold holdings with other assets to hedge against potential downside risk, and closely track market catalysts for further opportunities.
The dollar index (.DXY), opens new tab gained 0.5%, on track for its best day in over a week, making greenback-priced bullion more expensive for holders of other currencies.
"Some of the comments of President-elect Donald Trump towards the BRICS countries not to move away from the U.S. dollar are supporting the dollar and moderately weighing on the gold prices today," said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.
Trump on Saturday called on BRICS nations to pledge not to establish or endorse an alternative currency to the U.S. dollar, warning of 100% tariffs for non-compliance.
Bullion fell over 3% in November, its steepest monthly drop since September 2023, amid fears that Trump's tariff plans could prolong higher interest rates.
The ongoing slowdown in U.S. economic activity is expected to prompt further Fed rate cuts in December, boosting investment demand and driving gold to $2,900/oz by mid-2025, Staunovo added.
Major brokerages maintain their expectation of a 25 basis-point Fed rate cut in December, following PCE price index data aligning with market forecasts on Wednesday.
Key U.S. economic events this week include job openings data, ADP employment report and non-farm payrolls. Speeches from Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, will also draw attention.
"Gold's perceived status as a safe haven asset could continue to support demand – given ongoing policy uncertainty that could negatively impact the global economy, as well as various geopolitical tensions – along with purchases by central banks," NAB analysts said in a note.
