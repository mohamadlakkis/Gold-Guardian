Traders flipped to net-short yen, derisked from AUD/USD, gold: COT report 

Large speculators joined asset managers with a net-short exposure to yen futures ahead of the BOJ meeting, although their bearish positioning may be ‘short lived’ if the central bank really is a step closer to raising rates. De-risking also appears to be in the air ahead of the US election looking at positioning across AUD/USD, gold and the VIX.

Large speculators joined asset managers with a net-short exposure to yen futures ahead of the BOJ meeting, although their bearish positioning may be ‘short lived’ if the central bank really is a step closer to raising rates. De-risking also appears to be in the air ahead of the US election looking at positioning across AUD/USD, gold and the VIX.

 
Market positioning from the COT report – Tuesday, 29 October 2024:

    Large speculators were net-short EUR/USD futures for a second week, increasing gross shorts by 15.4% (27.9k contracts)
    They also flipped to net-short JPY futures, increasing gross short exposure by 34.8% (23.2k contracts)
    Asset managers and large speculators appear to be derisking from AUD/USD futures by trimming longs and shorts
    Early signs of a gold top could be forming with both sets of traders reducing gross-short exposure by a combined 14.8k contracts and reducing longs by -12.4k contracts
    Asset managers pushed net-long exposure to VIX futures to a 1-year high while large specs reverted to net-short exposure

Gold futures (GC) positioning – COT report:

I’m seeing further signs that all may not be well for gold at these giddy heights. Both large speculators and managed funds reduced long and short exposure to gold last week, which also went on to close with a weekly bearish pinbar.

Gross shorts rose to a 49-week high of 878k contracts among large speculators, and a 23-week high of 39.7k contracts among asset managers. Longs were reduced by a combined -12.4k contracts. The result was net-long exposure being dragged lower by a total of -15.3k contracts between the traders. This is not a large amount in the grand scheme of things, but it does show a certain level of nervousness from bulls around the $2700 area and suggests we may see a correction before prices eventually go on to tag $3000 next year.

        Short positions: Show a recent surge, rising to a combined gross-short exposure of 127.7k contracts.

        Net Exposure: Large speculators maintain a net bullish position, albeit narrowing.

3. Moving Averages

    No explicit moving averages are shown. However:
        The sustained upward trend in long positions suggests strong investor confidence in gold's medium- to long-term value.
        The increasing short positions may indicate short-term correction risks.

4. Historical Comparisons

    2020 Surge: Gold prices spiked during the pandemic, driven by a flight to safe-haven assets.
    2023-2024 Consolidation: Speculative longs remain near record highs, but shorts have grown significantly, marking a potential divergence in sentiment compared to 2020-2022 trends.

5. Market Indicators

    Bullish Indicators:
        Sustained growth in gross long positions reflects confidence in gold as a hedge against economic uncertainty.
        The upward trend in prices suggests strong demand and support levels around $2,500.

    Bearish Indicators:
        The sharp increase in gross short positions signals a potential correction in gold prices if bearish sentiment persists.

6. Future Projections

    Upside Potential:
        If macroeconomic uncertainty persists (e.g., inflation, geopolitical risks), gold could break above $2,739 and test new highs.
        Continued net-long dominance supports a positive outlook in the medium term.

    Downside Risks:
        Rising short positions may result in a pullback toward support levels near $2,500 or lower.
        A shift in economic conditions (e.g., reduced inflation concerns, stronger USD) could amplify bearish momentum.

7. Investor Decision Support

    Opportunities:
        Investors should consider long positions in gold, leveraging the medium-term upward momentum.
        Short-term traders might capitalize on corrections by monitoring the increase in bearish speculative activity.

    Warnings:
        Monitor the sharp rise in gross shorts, which could signal increased volatility and downside risks in the near term.
        A break below key support levels (~$2,500) could indicate a trend reversal.
