    MLOps procedure: 
    		Phases of the MLOps Lifecycle

			Below are the key phases of the MLOps lifecycle and what you are expected to document for each:
			a) Data Engineering

			    Meaning: Preparing the data for training, validation, and testing.
			    What to Document:
				Data collection methods and sources.
				Data preprocessing steps (e.g., cleaning, normalization, feature engineering).
				Data pipeline design and tools used (e.g., Apache Airflow, Kubeflow).

			b) Model Development

			    Meaning: Designing, training, and validating the machine learning model.
			    What to Document:
				Model architecture and hyperparameters.
				Training datasets, validation techniques, and evaluation metrics.
				Results from various experiments (e.g., performance metrics, graphs).

			c) Model Deployment

			    Meaning: Integrating the model into production environments.
			    What to Document:
				Deployment strategy (e.g., batch processing, real-time inference).
				Tools and frameworks (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
				APIs or interfaces exposed for interacting with the model.

			d) Monitoring and Logging

			    Meaning: Continuously tracking the model's performance post-deployment.
			    What to Document:
				Tools and processes for monitoring model performance (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
				Key performance indicators (KPIs) monitored (e.g., accuracy, latency).
				Logging mechanisms and error handling.

			e) Model Maintenance and Retraining

			    Meaning: Keeping the model updated and relevant by retraining with new data.
			    What to Document:
				Criteria for model retraining (e.g., performance degradation).
				Pipeline for automating retraining and redeployment.
				Versioning of models and datasets.

			f) Reproducibility and Collaboration

			    Meaning: Ensuring that the project is reproducible and facilitates team collaboration.
			    What to Document:
				Code repositories (e.g., GitHub) and branching strategies.
				Dependency management (e.g., virtual environments, Docker images).
				Clear instructions for setting up and running the project.
		Purpose of Documentation

		    Reproducibility: Ensures that others can understand and replicate your work.
		    Accountability: Provides a clear record of decisions, methods, and results.
		    Scalability: Simplifies future scaling or updates to the project.
		    Professionalism: Demonstrates a structured approach aligned with industry standards.

ðŸš€ What's the Mission?
    Pitch Like Pros: Imagine you're on Shark Tank. Convince us (and our panel of industry experts) of the business value of your idea. Sell it with flair!
    ( as my intro see the video -> https://www.gold.org/ ) 


ðŸ›  Technical Requirements:

    Dockerize It: Containerize your application using Docker.
    Application should communicate through an API 
    GitHub Repository: Use GitHub for source control and present your idea with a proper README file.
    No Tech Limitations: Any AI technology goes! Whether it's a novel linear regression model or cutting-edge deep learningâ€”if it solves a problem, it's in.
    Think Big: Feel free to consider this project as a proof of concept for your Final Year Project (FYP).
    Leverage LLMs Wisely: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) as APIs is acceptable, but ensure you include some trained components or make the project significant enough. Remember, it's the solution that counts!
    Sky's the Limit: You're not confined to our coursework. Explore, innovate, and if you need resources, I'm here to help.
    Document the Journey: In real-world projects, MLOps is as crucial as the model itself. Document all phases of the MLOps lifecycle for extra kudos.


ðŸ“¬ Submission Criteria:

    GitHub Page: This is your project's home base.
    5-Minute "Shark Tank" Presentation: You'll have 5 minutes to wow us. Industry experts might drop by to evaluate your masterpiece!
