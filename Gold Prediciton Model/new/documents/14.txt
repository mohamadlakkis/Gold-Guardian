Trump Bump Price Action Setups: Gold, Bitcoin, EUR/USD, SPX

It’s been a fast-evolving market since the Presidential election three weeks ago. But stocks remain higher, Bitcoin has put in a major move and gold is on its back foot. 

US Dollar, EUR/USD, USD/JPY Talking Points:

    The US Dollar hit a fresh two-year high last week as EUR/USD broke down but, interestingly, USD/JPY held a lower-high.
    There’s some remaining headline flow for this week ahead of the U.S. holiday, with FOMC meeting minutes out a little later today and then Core PCE set for release tomorrow morning.
    Below I share some charts from the webinar, focusing on setups around the US Dollar such as gold, Bitcoin, EUR/USD and SPX.


US Dollar

 

The USD spiked up to a fresh two-year-high last week, finally finding some resistance at the 108.00 level in DXY. The currency gapped-down to start this week which went along with a gap-up in EUR/USD but, so far, bulls have defended the 106.50 level well. That’s the lower-portion of the FOMC-fueled gap that built in November of last year. This keeps bulls in order as we near the FOMC minutes release, and tomorrow’s Core PCE remains a big deal as I discussed in the early-portion of the webinar.

For levels in DXY: 106.50 is support and 106-106.13 is below that. If bulls lose the handle there, then deeper retracement scenarios could be entertained and that’ll likely come along with a EUR/USD test through the 1.0611 level. But, in that backdrop, USD/JPY with a test at or around 151.95 may be the optimal focal point.

For resistance in DXY, 107.50 has already held a couple of attempts, including the weekly open and last night’s gap-up.

Trend Analysis:

    The price fluctuates within a yellow consolidation zone between 106.504 (support) and 106.884 (resistance).
    Upward spikes show attempts to break higher levels, peaking near 107.485, but fail to sustain momentum.
    The trend appears neutral in the short term, with no strong directional bias yet.

Key Metrics:

    Highest Price: 107.993 (recent peak, failed breakout attempt).
    Lowest Price: 106.130 (nearest key support outside consolidation).
    Volatility: Price movements exhibit moderate volatility, confined within a 1-point range (106.504 to 107.485).

Moving Averages:

    No visible moving averages are depicted on the chart; potential reliance on support/resistance levels dominates.

Historical Comparisons:

    Recent price action within the consolidation zone resembles prior range-bound behavior.
    Breakout attempts above the upper resistance have been short-lived in the past.

Market Indicators:

    Support Levels:
        Immediate support: 106.504.
        Key support: 106.130 (potential trend reversal point if breached).
    Resistance Levels:
        Immediate resistance: 106.884.
        Key resistance: 107.485 (recent rejection point).
    Breakout Attempts:
        107.485 acts as a ceiling; consistent failures suggest sellers dominate at higher levels.

Future Projections:

    Bullish Scenario:
        A breakout above 107.485 could target 107.993 and potentially higher levels if momentum sustains.
    Bearish Scenario:
        A breakdown below 106.504 could drive prices toward 106.130, and a breach of this level may indicate a deeper correction.
    Neutral Scenario:
        Continued range-bound movement between 106.504 and 107.485 in the short term.

Investor Decision Support:

    Opportunities:
        Long positions may be considered on a confirmed breakout above 107.485, with tight stop-losses below the level.
        Short positions may be viable on a break below 106.504, targeting 106.130.
    Warnings:
        Watch for false breakouts near 107.485 or 106.504; confirmation is crucial before committing to trades.
        Monitor overall market sentiment and correlations with other assets (e.g., gold and equities), as DXY movements often inversely impact them.
Gold

 

Gold was flying high for most of the year as the Fed remained dovish even with inflation showing signs of entrenchment. It’s suddenly started to pullback in Q4 and as I posited in the webinar, I think it’s because there’s a degree of competition in anti-fiat flows, namely in Bitcoin but that statement can be spanned across the crypto market. And given President Trump’s courting of the crypto crowd ahead of the election, that can make sense.

But, with that said, I’m not expecting the new administration to usher in an era of austerity as Trump can be considered a market-friendly force.

So, I retain a bullish fundamental bias on gold, and the big question now is whether the technical backdrop shows the same. There’s been a grasping of support at 2617-2621 so far this week but there’s also resistance just overhead from 2643-2650. If bulls can trade through that, then the door can open wider for recovery themes. But – if seller should resistance in that prior support zone, there’s greater pullback potential to 2600, 2575 and then 2550, and that’s the level that buyers would need to hold to keep the door open for bounce scenarios.
