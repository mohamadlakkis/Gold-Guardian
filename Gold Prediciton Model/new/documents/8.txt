Traders were cautious with USD, gold, VIX ahead of the election: COT report 
As the latest COT data is up to the close of election day, it shows how traders were positioned ahead of the results. Subsequent market moves suggest they needn't have piled into VIX longs and could have increased net-long exposure to the USD. But they were right to be wary of gold.
Market positioning from the COT report – Tuesday, 5 November 2024:

    The latest COT data shows us market positioning up to the close of the day of the US election, and therefore will not show us how traders reacted to the results

3. Moving Averages

    Moving averages are not explicitly shown, but the consistent speculative positions in assets like gold and equities suggest stable trends above key support levels.

4. Historical Comparisons

    Gold and Silver:
        Current bullish speculative interest mirrors trends seen during periods of economic uncertainty or rising inflation.
    Currencies:
        The persistently bearish stance in CAD and JPY highlights continued weakness relative to other asset classes.
    Equities:
        The strong bullish sentiment in S&P 500 and Nasdaq reflects ongoing confidence in equity markets, consistent with previous growth cycles.

5. Market Indicators

    Gold and Silver: Strong net long positioning suggests robust demand for safe-haven assets.
    Equities: High speculative interest in S&P 500 and Nasdaq signals potential for further bullish momentum in equity indices.
    Currencies: Continued bearish sentiment in CAD and JPY underscores their underperformance relative to other currencies.
    Bonds: Preference for short-duration bonds (2-Year Note) highlights market expectations for interest rate adjustments or economic uncertainty.

6. Future Projections

    Gold and Silver: Likely to maintain upward momentum unless there is a significant shift in economic sentiment or monetary policy.
    Equities: The S&P 500 and Nasdaq could continue to attract speculative interest, supporting potential price appreciation.
    Currencies: CAD and JPY are expected to remain under pressure unless fundamental shifts in economic or monetary policy occur.
    Bonds: Speculative interest may remain focused on short-term bonds, especially if interest rate hikes are anticipated.

7. Investor Decision Support

    Opportunities:
        Consider long positions in gold, silver, and equities (S&P 500, Nasdaq) to align with strong speculative interest.
        WTI crude oil offers moderate bullish potential, particularly if global demand strengthens.
    Warnings:
        CAD and JPY show persistent bearish trends, making them less favorable for long positions.
        Be cautious with long-term bonds (10-Year Bond), as speculative interest remains muted.
    Strategic Insight:
        Diversify positions across bullish assets like gold, silver, and equities while hedging exposure to underperforming currencies.
        Monitor changes in speculative positioning for early signs of sentiment shifts.

US dollar positioning (IMM data) – COT report:

The USD index increased for a sixth week and formed a bullish engulfing candle. Positioning was a little hesitant to overcommit to USD longs before the election, as the week-over-week change among all futures contracts was effectively flat. Yet traders are clearly bullish on the USD overall, even if large speculators were only marginally net-long by 95 contracts. I suspect they will close the gap with asset managers in coming weeks to increase their net-long exposure.

        Recent High: 109.32.
        Support Level: Near 100.00.

3. Moving Averages

    The chart does not explicitly display moving averages, but:
        The sustained rise in the USD index above 100 suggests that prices are trading above longer-term moving averages.
        The flattening in recent net positioning may indicate potential alignment with short-term moving averages, signaling a consolidation phase.

4. Historical Comparisons

    2006-2013 vs. 2024:
        The USD's current net long positioning remains below historical highs of $23.45 billion (2013) but has significantly recovered from the lows seen in previous cycles.
    Q3 2023 to Q4 2024:
        USD net positioning and price have shown consistent increases, reflecting a strong demand for the currency amid macroeconomic shifts.

5. Market Indicators

    Support Levels:
        USD Index: Near-term support at 100.00.
    Resistance Levels:
        Immediate resistance around 109.32, representing the recent cycle high.
    Sentiment:
        Persistent bullish positioning among futures traders and asset managers reinforces confidence in the USD.

6. Future Projections

    Bullish Scenario:
        If the USD index sustains above 104.00, further upside toward the resistance at 109.32 is likely, especially if net long positioning increases.
    Bearish Scenario:
        A breakdown below 100.00 could trigger a deeper correction, as speculative traders may reduce long exposure.
    Neutral Scenario:
        Continued flat weekly changes in net positioning may result in consolidation near current levels.

7. Investor Decision Support

    Opportunities:
        Long positions in the USD index are supported by strong net positioning and the bullish engulfing pattern at the cycle high.
        Monitor for potential breakout opportunities above 109.32 for further upside.
    Warnings:
        Flat weekly changes in positioning suggest caution, as the USD may enter a consolidation phase.
        A break below 100.00 would invalidate the bullish setup, signaling a possible reversal.
    Strategic Insight:
        Use stop-loss levels near 100.00 for long positions to manage downside risks.
        Diversify currency exposure to hedge against potential reversals in USD strength.

Metals (gold, silver, copper) futures - COT report:

It seems gold and silver traders were right to be wary of extended gains heading into the US election, with net-long exposure felling for a second week. The shooting star week which formed on god futures was the perfect prelude to last week’s post-election selloff, and a correction is now underway. And with Trump driving headlines and US data generally outperforming more than not, it keeps hawkish pressure on the Fed, which supports yields and the USD to the detriment of gold. And where gold goes, silver tends to follow.

Positioning for copper was essentially unchanged, but then it hasn’t had the luxury of a strong rally before this point. Traders will want to keep a close eye on China data this week to see if stimulus has began to make an impact on the economy, alongside US-China relations going forward.

        Silver offers range-trading opportunities, buying near $28 and selling near $32.
        Copper provides opportunities for both range-bound strategies and breakout trades above $4.50.
    Warnings:
        Be cautious of potential corrections in gold if speculative positioning decreases or economic sentiment shifts.
        Silver’s weaker speculative interest may limit upside potential.
        Copper’s volatility requires tight risk management and stop-loss levels.
    Strategic Insight:
        Focus on gold as the primary bullish asset, given its robust speculative and managed fund interest.
        Diversify exposure with silver and copper for tactical trades, monitoring macroeconomic catalysts closely.
